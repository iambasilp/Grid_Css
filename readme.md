## What is CSS Grid

Grid Layout is a new layout model for CSS that has powerful abilities to control the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents. Unlike Flexible Box Layout, which is single-axisâ€“oriented, Grid Layout is optimized for 2-dimensional layouts: those in which alignment of content is desired in both dimensions.
